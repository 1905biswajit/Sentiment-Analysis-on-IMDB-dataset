# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-dataset

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can access and download it using the following link: [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

## Conclusion:
In this task, we implemented and compared two deep learning models, an LSTM and a CNN, to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative. Both models were trained on the same dataset and evaluated across key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to determine which model provides a more effective solution for sentiment analysis on this dataset. The CNN model outperformed the LSTM model in accuracy, recall, and F1 score, demonstrating a more balanced performance for both positive and negative reviews. This indicates that the CNN model was better able to generalize to the unseen test data, achieving a
higher overall classification accuracy and capturing positive cases more effectively. While the LSTM achieved slightly higher precision, suggesting it was slightly more conservative with positive predictions, it had a lower recall, indicating that it missed more positive reviews. The comparison highlights the CNN's ability to capture local features and hierarchical patterns in text effectively, which proves beneficial
for sentiment analysis in this task. The LSTM, while useful for understanding sequence dependencies, may have been less effective due to potential overfitting or a need for further tuning.
